      <p id="p2">The Soviet Union quickly followed suit in the pursuit of achieving similar military powers to be able to combat the US during the cold war, launching their first nuclear bomb only 4 years later on August 29, 1949, in what is now known as Kazakhstan. At present, they have access to a total of 6,257 warheads, the most of any country.</p>

      <p id="p2">The United Kingdom, an ally to the US during the 2nd World War, would not be left behind in the pursuit of a greater power. On the 3rd of October in 1952, they would detonate their first atomic bomb called 'Hurricane'. At present they have a total of 225 warheads.</p>

      <p id="p2">Israel had their first suspected nuclear test in 1960, in an unknown location. The most recent guess for their first test is 1979, at an also unkown location. These approximations are based on guesses and reports. Israel currently has 90 total warheads.</p>

      <p id="p2">Last, we have North Korea. This country is the most recent to have developed nuclear explosive technology, having their first test just in 2006. Despite what their leader seems to suggest, they actually have the least amount of total warheads deployed of any country (that we know of) at only 45.</p>
